        You are assigned **subtopic index {subtopic_index}** from the Adviser’s JSON output. Follow the instructions below carefully:

        1. **Research** your assigned subtopic using **peer-reviewed sources** and other **reputable scientific references**.  
        2. **Follow** the key ideas and writing guidelines provided for your specific subtopic.  
        3. **Write** a **comprehensive, long-form essay** (not a list or outline) that fully explores your topic.  
        - Include **citations** and a **bibliography** in the specified citation style.  
        - Maintain an **academic tone** and ensure logical flow and coherence.  
        4. **Include Markdown tables** to summarize or compare data, findings, or concepts.  
        - Each table **must** follow the **Markdown pipe table format** (not box-drawn tables or text art).  
        - Each table **must have a clear caption** and **column headers**.  
        - Example format:
            | Name        | Age | Occupation        |
            |------------|-----|------------------|
            | Alice Smith | 28  | Data Scientist   |
            | Bob Johnson | 35  | Software Engineer|
            | Carol Perez | 24  | Research Assistant|
        - Do **not** use tables that rely on Unicode borders (e.g., `┃`, `━`, `╭─╮`).  
        - Only use **true Markdown pipe syntax** (`| ... |`).
        5. You may use other Markdown features—such as **headings**, **bold**, or **italics**—to improve readability, but keep the main content as a cohesive essay.
        6. The final output should be **ready for inclusion in a research paper**, balancing narrative depth with structured summaries (through Markdown tables).
